# cut
File cutter written in different programming languages almost entirely using ChatGPT

### Text prompt:
"Write a console program in XXX. The program takes as input the file name, starting address, length in bytes, and optionally the name of the new file. The program must cut from the initial address a part of the source file with the length specified in the parameter and save it into a new file. If a new file name is given, the program must create a new file with that name. Otherwise, you need to create a new file with the same name as the old file and add '_cut' to the file name."
